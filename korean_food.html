      <p>
        The reason why I like Korean meat, which is different from steak or
        barbecue meat eaten abroad, is because of the style of eating meat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Put the meat on the fire board on the table and then enjoy after roasting it.

      <p>
        We can have fried chicken in all around the world, but Korea has various kinds of fried chicken.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, seasoned spicy chicken, soy sauce chicken and so on. Korean people usually have fried chicken with beer.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's really good taste and I want to recommend to have them.

        I like tteok-bokki very much. It is stir-fried rice cake and called 'tteok-bokki'.

      <p>
        It is a rice cake with red hot pepper paste. The rice cake is a finger size white chewy food made with white rice.

        The red hot pepper paste is made with flour and red hot pepper or Jalepino pepper.

      <p>
        It is spicy, but we can choose the level of spicy before we order it.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can add  fish cake, boiled egg or even ramyun in it.
