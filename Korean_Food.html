			<p>
				The reason why I like Korean meat, which is different from steak or
				barbecue meat eaten abroad, is because of the style of eating meat.
			</P>
			<p>
				Put the meat on the fire board on the table and then enjoy after roasting it. 			
			</p>
		
		<h3><strong>2. Fried Chicken and Beer</strong></h3>

			<p>
				We can have fried chicken in all around the world, but Korea has various kinds
				of fried chicken.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, seasoned spicy chicken, soy sauce chicken and so on. Korean people 
				usually have fried chicken with beer.
			</p>
			<p>
				That's really good taste and I want to recommend to have them.
			</p>

			<p>
				I like tteok-bokki very much. It is stir-fried rice cake and called 'tteok-bokki'.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is a rice cake with red hot pepper paste. The rice cake is a finger size white 
				chewy food made with white rice.
			</p>
			<p>
				The red hot pepper paste is made with flour and red hot pepper or Jalepino pepper.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is spicy, but we can choose the level of spicy before we order it.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can add  fish cake, boiled egg or even ramyun in it.			
			</p>
			
		<h3><strong>4. Bibimbap</strong></h3>

				Bibimbap is kind of mixed rice. 
			</p>

				The ingredient of it is a bowl of warm white rice topped with 
				namul which is seasoned vegetables and gochujang
			</p>
			<p>
				which means chili pepper paste. Additionally, the fried egg or sliced beef is on 
				the very top of Bibimbap.
			</p>

				Samgyetang is the representative invigorating food of Korea. Most of Korean people have it
				in summer,
			</p>
			<p>
				especially on the hottest day. Samgyetang is a food that is eaten by boiling ingredients 
				such as ginseng and jujube together with chicken.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is good for rejuvenating your health. It's a great menu for foreigners to eat
				without burden.
